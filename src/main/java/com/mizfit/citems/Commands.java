    // for commands you'll have to either
    // 1. register them in spigots CommandMap (from the bukkit/server class) directly
    // 2. Use a library like ACF or some other command library to register and create commands for you
    // 3. Go back to a normal plugin.yml, paper still supports a normal plugin.yml too.
